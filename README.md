## Getting Started
For the purpose of this exercise, a `dev-config.yaml` file has been committed in the repository with the config variables
already added to allow for quick setup. The source directory must exist for the application to start, if not you will get
an error similar to:
```
2025/05/19 21:51:24 ERROR source directory does not exist err="stat ./tmp/different/src: no such file or directory"
```
